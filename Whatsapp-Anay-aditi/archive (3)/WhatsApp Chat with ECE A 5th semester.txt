Get ready to unlock the world of programming excitement with CodeVita!

Launched in 2012, TCS CodeVita is a global programming competition designed to identify top coders around the world. It's a dynamic contest that unites people from diverse backgrounds and cultures, shattering boundaries. The "Guinness Book of World Records" listed TCS CodeVita as 'The world's largest programming contest' with registrations from 98 countries/regions, proving it as a true global phenomenon.

In Season 11, participation soared to 444k+ contestants, representing 3,500+ institutes. Imagine participants from 10 regions engaging in an electrifying battle during the grand finale!

This year, we are "United by Code", celebrating a global community bound by the shared passion for programming. This season 12 promises more thrilling challenges and unforgettable experiences, highlighting the unity and diversity of coders worldwide.

Are you intrigued? Brace yourself for another extraordinary journey with TCS CodeVita, where coding transcends boundaries.

From any recognized institute across the globe
10/15/24, 10:39 AM - +91 98878 52862: *Sample Question*

A solid cube of 10 cm x 10cm x 10 cm rests on the ground.  It has a beetle on it, and some sweet honey spots at various locations on the surface of the cube.  The beetle starts at a point on the surface of the cube, and goes to the honey spots in order along the surface of the cube.

Problem Description
A solid cube of 10 cm x 10cm x 10 cm rests on the ground.  It has a beetle on it, and some sweet honey spots at various locations on the surface of the cube.  The beetle starts at a point on the surface of the cube, and goes to the honey spots in order along the surface of the cube.

1.      If it goes from a point to another point on the same face (say X to Y), it goes in an arc of a circle that subtends an angle of 60 degrees at the centre of the circle

2.      If it goes from one point to another on a different face, it goes by the shortest path on the surface of the cube, except that it never travels along the bottom of the cube

The beetle is a student of Cartesian geometry, and knows the coordinates (x, y, z) of all the points it needs to go to.  The origin of coordinates it uses is one corner of the cube on the ground, and the z axis points up.  Hence, the bottom surface (on which it does not crawl) is z=0, and the top surface is z=10.  The beetle keeps track of all the distances travelled, and rounds the distance travelled to two decimal places once it reaches the next spot, so that the final distance is a sum of the rounded distances from spot to spot.


Input
The first line gives an integer N, the total number of points (including the starting point) the beetle visits

The second line is a set of 3N comma separated non-negative numbers, with up to two decimal places each.  These are to be interpreted in groups of three as the x, y, z coordinates of the points the beetle needs to visit in the given order.

Output
One line with a number giving the total distance travelled by the beetle accurate to two decimal places.  Even if the distance travelled is an integer, the output should have two decimal places.

Constraints
None of the points the beetle visits is on the bottom face (z=0) or on any of the edges of the cube (the lines where two faces meet)

Examples
Example 1

Input

1,1,10,2,1,10,0,1,9

Output

4.05

Explanation

There are three points visited by the beetle (N=3). The beetle starts on the top face of the cube (z=10) at point (1,1,10) and goes to another point on the same face (2,1,10).  Though the straight line distance is 1, it travels on the arc of a circle subtending an angle of 60 degrees at the centre of the circle, and hence travels (2*pi)/6 or 1.05 (note that it rounds the distance at each leg of the journey).  It then travels from (2,1,10) on the face z=10 to (0,1,9) on the face x=0 along the surface of the cube. This is a distance of 3.  The total distance travelled is 1.05+3=4.05.  The output is 4.05

Example 2

Input

3

1,1,10,2,1,10,0,5,9

Output

6.05

Explanation

There are three points visited by the beetle (N=3). The beetle starts on the top face of the cube (z=10) at point (1,1,10) and goes to another point on the same face (2,1,10).  As before. This distance is 1.05.   It then travels from (2,1,10) on the face z=10 to (0,5,9) on the face x=0 along the surface of the cube. The shortest distance on the surface of the cube between these points is 5.  The total distance travelled is 1.05+5=6.05.  The output is 6.05.

They are habits that need to be inculcated and developed through experiential learning . 
Each interaction leads to knowing yourself better. 
Each experience leads to your self development. 

You must now be more focused on your behaviour improvement. 

*Behavioural improvement*
1)doesn't  mean you have a bad behaviour. 
It means you need to work on developing your behaviour while working in an organisation. 
2) Discipline 
3).Self awareness 
4) Ownership and responsibility 
5)presentation skills 
6) Interaction and confidence 
7) Spoken and written communication 
8) body language 
9) people dealing skills 

These are the crust of soft skills that had over 300 sub topics. 
These skills are learnt through training and practicing practical. 
Like you going to gym to improve your physical  appearance and strength 

Soft skills refine's  your mental, emotional and physical appearance . Making you a better version of yourself. 
Give yourself the opportunity to be better. 
You are responsible for your career,your tomorrow and your family's happiness 
Make your parents proud by reaching the highest possibilities in your career. 

If you understand this you will never miss any opportunity to learn.

Thanks

We encourage all participants to attend this session. Looking forward to your active participation.

Brief Overview on need of Photonics Designer EDA Tool:

For Photonics Design Engineers who need a holistic photonics workflow from concept to validation and compliance, Keysight’s Photonics Designer is a photonic design automation (PDA) tool that leverages advanced simulation technology grounded in physics-based models to ensure unparalleled accuracy and precision to predict real-world photonics circuit performance. Unlike multi-vendor solutions, Keysight’s Photonics Designer enables effortless generation and validation of pure optical, electro-optical (EO), or opto-electrical (OE) circuit layouts against stringent design rules, guaranteeing precision and reliability in every design.

If you’re in the field of Photonic Circuit Designer / Foundry / Research Group and your application may involve Optical IO / Computing / Sensing, this session would be of interest to you.

Note:
Registration is mandatory. Once registered, you will be receiving a link for attending the session.

5/4/25, 9:38 AM - +91 87643 14378: It has been observed that many students are not following instructions and are showing a lack of respect towards teachers & college responsibilities. This kind of behavior is unacceptable and goes against the values of discipline and responsibility we uphold.
As a result, all club activities and extracurricular programs will be temporarily suspended until further notice. Academic focus, discipline, and mutual respect are our top priorities, and any behavior that disrupts this will not be tolerated.
